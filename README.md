#  Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data Analysis

## Dataset Overview:

The EHR dataset contains records for 10 patients.
Each patient record includes demographic information such as patient ID, age, gender, as well as medical details like diagnosis codes, procedure codes, blood pressure, height, weight, and BMI.


## Insights:

Age Distribution: Patients' ages range from 35 to 69 years, with a mean age of approximately 47.5 years.
Gender Distribution: The dataset includes both male and female patients.
Health Parameters:

Blood Pressure: Recorded blood pressure readings are provided in the systolic/diastolic format.

Height and Weight: Patient heights range from approximately 152 cm to 181 cm, with weights varying from around 60 kg to 80 kg.

BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI values range from approximately 22.86 to 25.95, with a mean BMI of approximately 24.75. This suggests that, on average, patients fall within the normal weight range.

## Analysis Summary:
1. Correlation Analysis:

The correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between certain health parameters.
For example, there may be a positive correlation between weight and BMI, indicating that as weight increases, BMI tends to increase as well.

2. Gender-based Comparisons:

Gender-based comparisons highlighted potential differences in health parameters between male and female patients.
For instance, the t-tests may reveal that male patients have significantly higher average weights compared to female patients.
